A warm invitation to contribute.

I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn more theory, or that your additions and suggestions won't be good enough.

I assure you, that's not the case.

<!--This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can read here (link).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.-->

You can help out not only by directly improving the glossary, but also by giving feedback about this work. <!--(And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)-->

Thank you for contributing!
