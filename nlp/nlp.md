Natural Language Processing
===========================

Natural language processing (NLP) is the collection of methods used for computers to analyse and derive meaning from human language. It is a field at the intersection of computer science, data science and linguistics. [[Matt Kiser, Algorithmia](https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-natural-language-processing-nlp/)]

### Methods

### Terms

##### Named Entitiy
A named entity is any real world object such as a person, location, organisation or product with a proper name. [[Spacy Tutorial]

##### Noun Chunk
A phrase based upon nouns recovered from tokenized text using the speech tags. [[Spacy Tutorial]
